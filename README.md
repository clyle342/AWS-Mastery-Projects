# AWS Mastery: 26 Hands-On Projects for Ndombson & Co.

## Overview
This repository contains my work for the **AWS Mastery: 26 Hands-On Projects for Aspiring Cloud Engineers** course, where I built and documented 26 real-world AWS projects for a fictional company, **Ndombson & Co.**. Leveraging my **AWS Cloud Practitioner** and **KCNA (Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate)** certifications, I implemented secure, scalable, and cost-efficient cloud solutions using AWS services like VPC, EC2, S3, IAM, Lambda, and more. All projects were executed within an **AWS Free Tier** account, emphasizing cost optimization and best practices.

Each project folder includes a detailed README with objectives, steps, AWS services used, code snippets, screenshots, challenges, and lessons learned. This portfolio showcases my hands-on experience in cloud engineering, from setting up secure AWS environments to deploying serverless applications and optimizing infrastructure for scalability.

2. **Install AWS CLI**: Configure the CLI for programmatic AWS management (Project 2).
3. **Follow Project Folders**: Each folder contains a README with detailed steps, code, and screenshots.
4. **Monitor Costs**: Use AWS Budgets to stay within Free Tier limits (Project 1).

## Tools & Technologies

- **Tools**: AWS CLI, Git, GitHub, VS Code.
- **Certifications Applied**: AWS Cloud Practitioner, KCNA (Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate).

## Lessons Learned
- Mastered secure AWS account setup, IAM policies, and cost management.
- Gained hands-on experience with S3, EC2, VPC, and serverless architectures.
